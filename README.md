# AstonTourismApp
For my mobile design module for university, I created a 'travel journal' application for Android, where users can create posts to record moments on holidays.

The user can create a holiday, and then link posts, photos and visited locations to the holiday. Then the user can edit and remove these posts.

In addition, the app shows nearby locations of interest for the user and an interactive map which displays the locations of previous posts.
